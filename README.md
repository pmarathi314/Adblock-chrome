# Adblock-chrome
A google chrome extension for blocking troublesome ads.

## Timeline
5/24/2022 - Finished getting a barebones version working on manifest v2. However, you have to manually change the black listed URLs.
5/25/2022 - Upgraded barebones version to manifest v3.
## Future Plans:
1. Figure out a way that I don't have to hard code the blocked websites.
2. Implement a script to scan through https://github.com/anudeepND/blacklist to update black listed sites
3. Make it so extension manually scrapes through the blacklisted sites and updates automatically. Not sure if possible?
