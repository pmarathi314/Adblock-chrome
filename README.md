# Adblock-chrome
A google chrome extension for blocking troublesome ads.

## Timeline
5/24/2022 - Finished getting a barebones version working on manifest v2. However, you have to manually change the black listed URLs.

## Future Plans:
1. Update to manifest version 3 so this doesn't get deprecated
2. Implement a script to scan through https://github.com/anudeepND/blacklist to update black listed sites
3? Make it so extension manually scrapes through the blacklisted sites and updates automatically. Not sure if possible?
